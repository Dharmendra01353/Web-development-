Led by Rohit Sharma, <br>India are coming off a 3-0 ODI series sweep against England; hence, they are high on confidence. <br>The Men in Blue last won the Champions Trophy in 2013 under the leadership of MS Dhoni and notably remained unbeaten throughout. <br> Having won the T20 World Cup 2024, the Asian Giants are looking to win their second successive ICC title.

    The 37-year-old scored a drought-breaking century in Cuttack against England, mustering 119 off 90 deliveries to silence the critics about his recent form.</h3>

<h3> Meanwhile, ace right-arm speedster Jasprit Bumrah will be unavailable for Team India's <br>Champions Trophy campaign as he continues to recover from the back injury he sustained during the five-Test series in Australia. <br>Although media reports suggested that chief selector Ajit Agarkar thought his medical report was okay but didn't want to risk Bumrah, <br>especially with plenty of cricket coming up later this year.

    Plenty of responsibility will be on Mohammed Shami, who is likely to spearhead <br>the attack and did decently in the preceding ODI series in England.</h3>
